Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment

It is an Android application that contains information about the Covid19 Virus. It contains detailed information about all countries.
Daily case numbers, death numbers can be learned. I code the project in Java language. Retrofit, Picasso technologies are used.<br>

## Which API are you using ? ü§î

I'm using this API in Android Application : https://corona.lmao.ninja<br><br>
This Api is perfect. Build anything from console widgets to mobile applications with our free and easy to use API.<br>

When the application is opened, a screen listing all countries is shown. This screen shows how many people have died in total in the all countries so far. By swiping up and down on the main page, you can find out the number of people who died from corona virus in all countries.
